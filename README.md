# Database
   GitApps database was made in Microsoft SQL and contains tables for Admins, Moderators, Accounts, Apps, and Comments.
   Each of the tables contain unique identifiers (i.e. ModeratorID, AppID, CommentID, etc) so that we can easily keep track of information stored in the tables.
   The Admins, Moderators, and Accounts tables contain a name/username and passwords as fields so that admins, moderators, and normal users can login.
   The Comments table references AppID (the specific app being commented about) and AccountID (which account/user is posting the comment) for organization.
